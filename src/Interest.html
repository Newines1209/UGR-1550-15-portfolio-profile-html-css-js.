I’m always learning new techniques and staying up-to-date with trends, and I enjoy how makeup can boost confidence and help people feel their best.

        <p>
          I'm passionate about coding, which allows me to solve problems and create functional, innovative solutions. Whether building websites, developing apps, or exploring new programming languages, I enjoy the challenge of making ideas come to life through code. Coding has taught me the importance of attention to detail and continuous learning, and I love how it combines creativity with logic.
